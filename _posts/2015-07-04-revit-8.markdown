Create and open BCF files directly within Autodesk Revit 2015 and 2016. With BCFier you can create isseus of 3D and 2D* views, add multiple views and comments to an issue and easily share them with other team members. BCFier also features a standalone Windows app that lets you review BCF files without the need of third party tools. 
<br/><br/>
Check out the [User Guide](/userguide) on how to get started.
</p>
*2D views are not a feature part of BCF therefore this functionality will only work in Revit.
